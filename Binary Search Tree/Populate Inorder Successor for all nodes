Input:
       10
       /  \
      8   12
     /
    3
Output: 3->8 8->10 10->12 12->-1
Explanation: The inorder of the above tree is : 3 8 10 12. So the next pointer of node 3 is pointing to 8 , next pointer of 8 is pointing to 10 and so on.And next pointer of 12 is pointing to -1 as there is no inorder successor of 12.


class Solution {
    Node prev = null;
    public void populateNext(Node root) {
        // code here
        if(root==null){
            return;
        }
        
        populateNext(root.right);//reverse inorder
        
        root.next = prev;
        
        prev = root;
        
        populateNext(root.left);
    }
}
